# HearingAidAndroid
This application aims to do one simple task: Record the microphone sound, amplify it and play it back on the user's headphones to act as a simple, yet powerful hearing aid. 

## Download
Hang on, we've just started. But once the app is in a publishable state, it will be published to the google play store. But for now, you need to clone the repo and build it for yourself in Android Studio.

## Features
- [x] Stream the amplified mic sound to the headphones
- [ ] Stream in realtime (~10 ms delay)
- [ ] Apply an equalizer to match personal hearing loss
- [ ] Easy setup wizard

(Unchecked items are still on our to do list)
