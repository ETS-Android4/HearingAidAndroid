# Microphone usage and audio processing

We use the microphone of your phone to record surrounding sounds and play them back through your headphones. The recording is never saved. It is thus technically impossible to access the audio after the app has been used. Furthermore, no audio data is transmitted to our servers nor to any other third party. All audio processing is done on your device.

# Crash reports

For troubleshooting, information about app crashes is transmitted to our servers using Firebase Crashlytics. The following information is transmitted to us anonymously in case of a crash:
- app version
- android version
- device model
- timestamp of the crash
- Other technical information (Logs that describe what lead to the crash, stacktrace, free RAM space, free memory space)

This data is transmitted anonymously and does not contain any personal information or information that might be used to track you down. The data collected is stored separately from any other data collected through the app and cannot be combined with it.

# Feedback

You have the possibility to submit feedback through the feedback feature in the sidebar. You can use this function to submit bug reports and suggestions for new features. Data you submit through this feature is sent to us via email. After clicking the "Send"-button in the feedback form, your email-app opens and you can review and modify all information that is sent to us prior to clicking the "Send"-button in your email-app, which will actually submit your feedback.

Information you submit to us using this feature is generally not published. The original email containing your feedback will be deleted once your feedback is implemented. However, we reserve the right to publish your feedback as a so called GitHub Issue in our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/vatbub/HearingAidAndroid/issues). Before publishing your feedback, we will remove any personal information that was associated with your feedback. Information published on GitHub is subject to GitHub's privacy policy which can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/).

If you do not wish that we publish your feedback on GitHub, please let us know in your feedback message.

Please be aware that data transfer via the internet is subject to security risks and, therefore, complete protection against third-party access to transferred data cannot be ensured.
