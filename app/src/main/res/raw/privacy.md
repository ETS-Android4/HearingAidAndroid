# Microphone usage and audio processing

We use the microphone of your phone to record surrounding sounds and play them back through your headphones. The recording is never saved. It is thus technically impossible to access the audio after the app has been used. Furthermore, no audio data is transmitted to our servers nor to any other third party. All audio processing is done on your device.

# Crash reports

For troubleshooting, information about app crashes is transmitted to our servers using Firebase Crashlytics. The following information is transmitted to us anonymously in case of a crash:
- app version
- android version
- device model
- timestamp of the crash
- Other technical information (Logs that describe what lead to the crash, stacktrace, free RAM space, free memory space)

This data is transmitted anonymously and does not contain any personal information or information that might be used to track you down. The data collected is stored separately from any other data collected through the app and cannot be combined with it.

# Feedback

You have the possibility to submit feedback through the feedback feature in the sidebar. You can use this function to submit bug reports and suggestions for new features. Data you submit through this feature is stored as a so called "issue" in the GitHub repository of this app. Since this app's source code is publicly available ("open source"), the information submitted through issues is also publicly available and subject to GitHub's privacy policy which can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/). By design, GitHub issues cannot be deleted, however you can request us to remove any personal information that you submitted accidentally.
